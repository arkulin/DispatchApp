# DispatchApp

A simple Kivy application for flight dispatchers. The app provides:

- **Quiz**: Test your dispatcher knowledge with configurable quizzes and a result summary.
- **Airport Info**: Look up curfew, slot, and permit details for airports.

Launch `dispatcher_app/main.py` to start the application.

When starting the quiz, you can choose how many questions to answer. After the final question you'll see a summary of your results.

The widget layout is defined in `dispatcher_app/dispatcher.kv`. Modify this file
to adjust the look and feel or to apply custom themes.
